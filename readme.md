## Project Summary

This web application is designed so that the user is matched with potential band mates that fit their search criteria. The main idea is that bandmates connects musicians looking for a singer, drummer, guitarist etc in a specific location and skillset that the user is looking for.

In order to achieve this, our team, the blue barracoders, had to use various APIs from google maps api, random german profile api. The styling and format used to create the display and styling was bulma. The back-end functions that were used to generate random profiles were designed by Javascript functions and J.Query. This web/ application was designed by Josh Allan, Melanie Hall, Patrick Whelan and Baxter Cox.
