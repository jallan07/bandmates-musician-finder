# Bandmates

## Deployed Web App

- http://bit.ly/bandmates

## Project Summary

This web application is designed so that the user is matched with potential band mates that fit their search criteria. The main idea is that bandmates connects musicians looking for a singer, drummer, guitarist etc in a specific location and skillset that the user is looking for.

In order to achieve this, our team, the blue barracoders, had to use various APIs from google maps api, random german profile api. The styling and format used to create the display and styling was bulma. The back-end functions that were used to generate random profiles were designed by Javascript functions and J.Query. This web/ application was designed by Josh Allan, Melanie Hall, Patrick Whelan and Baxter Cox.

## User Story

- Iâ€™m an aspiring musician
- trying to find other musicians with similar interests and sounds
- so that I can form and play in a band.

## Technologies Used

- Bulma CSS Framework
- jQuery Library
- Font Awesome Library

## APIs

- Random German Profile Generator: https://rapidapi.com/dawn2k/api/random-german-profiles-and-names-generator
- Google Maps: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key

## Known Bugs

- There is a bug that currently results in a 30-second delay before seeing potential matches after clicking the submit button

## Ideas for Future Development

- Resolve bug that causes a 30 second delay in card creation of potential matches
- Add some sort of modal or on-screen alert that tells the user to select an option from the search dropdowns
- Allow the user to create their own profile
- Grab the geolocation of the user & set it to the start location for the maps API call
- Add SoundCloud links of the user's profile/bio card
- Develop further communication channels and notifications for musicians who find a good match
